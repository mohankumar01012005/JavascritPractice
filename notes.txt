## Why JavaScript? How Website Work
-Brain of Website

## VARIABLES
  ==>Containers to store values 
  ==>What you can
     -->First letter must be a letter,underscore(_)
     -->can use $
     -->can use a letter, number, under score
     -->no limit to length of variable name
  ==>What you can't
     -->can't use numbers at begining of variable name 
     -->can't use js reserved words
     -->can't use spaces
  **=>variables are Case sensitive 
## DATA TYPES
  ==> 6 Primitive data types
     -->Undefined = Undefined
     -->Boolean   = true or false
     -->Number    = 9
     -->String    = "mohan"
     -->Bigint    = 
   ## NaN = not a number


   ##Expressions and operators
      5+20        {5 is oparand, = is oparator}
      Expressions=Combinations of oparand and oparator 
   #types of OPRATORS
      1.assignment  ==>    (= symbol)  {assigning a value to left operand based on value of right side oparand}
      2.arithmatic  ==>  (+,-,*,/,%, increament and decreament)    {addition , subtraction, multiplication, modulo and division} {takes numerical valueas operands and returns a single numeric value}
                        increament oparator== X++(postfix), ++X(prefix)
                        Postfix(X++):The postfix oparator increaments and returns the value after increamenting 
                        Prefix(++X):the prefix oparator increaments and returns the value before increamenting
                        Decreament oparator== X--(postfix), --X(prefix)
                        Postfix(X--):The postfix oparator decreaments and returns the value after decreamenting
                        Prefix(++X):the prefix oparator decreaments and returns the value before decreamenting
      3.comparision ==> (<,>,=,!=,>=,<=) this oparator compars the operands and returns a logical value based on the comparision is true 
      4.logical     ==> (and , or, not)logical operators are used with Boolean value and returns Boolean valueas
                        and(&&)= true if and only if all the operands are true otherwise its false
                        or(||) = true if and only if one oparand is true
                        not(!) = takes true and returns false and viseversa 
                     
      5.string      ==> teh concatenation oparator(+), concatenates two strings and returns the union of two strings
      6.Conditional(ternary)
      7.Exponentioal==> ex=3**3,   (10**-1)==1/10

## Differense between == and ===
      == will check the value are same or not and returns true or false accordingly
      === will checks the value and the type of data  same or not and returns true or false accordingly
###CONTROL STATEMENTS AND LOOPS
   ##IF.. ELSE
      ==> the if statement executes a statement if a specified Condition is true if Condition is false other statement can be executed
          if(Condition){
            
          }else{

          }

      ##// truthy and falsy values in javascript

         ==>falsy values== 0, "", Undefined, null, NaN, false**,
         ===>if there is any falsy value  in is Condition then always the else part is executed.

   ##Conditional Ternary operator 
         ==>the only oparator which takes 3 operands
         ==>variablename = (Condition)? value1:value2       {if and else's shorter version}

   ##SWITCH STATEMENT
         ==>evalutes an Expression, matching the Expression's value to a case clause, and executes statement associated with that case.
      ##BREAK STATEMENT
         ==> Terminates the current loop , switch ,  or lable statement and transfer programme control to the statement following the Terminated statement
   
   ##WHILE LOOP
         ==>the while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test Condition evalutes to true
                  var num = 0;
                  //Block scope
                  while(num<=10){
                  console.log(num);     // Infinite Loop
                  ++num  
                  }  


   ##DO-WHILE LOOP
        ==> We will get the ourput directly and then the Condition will be checked
        
         ==>     var num = 0;
                  do{
                  console.log(num);     // Infinite Loop
                  ++num  
                  }while(num<=10);

   ## FOR LOOP
         ==>for(initializer; Condition; iteration)
             {
               //code to be executed
             }
